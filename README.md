# Ruby on Rails Mix App

Mix App is designed with Artists and Audio Engineers in mind. Mix App gives users the ability to toggle back and forth between multiple mixes of a song seamlessly. Whether you want to hear the difference between an unmixed version and a mixed version of a song, or you need help deciding between two different mixes, Mix App allows you to upload the various versions of a track, and play them back easily from your phone. This enables you to listen to each mix on multiple sound sources (for example: in the car, on a home stereo set up, etc.) without having to lug around a laptop or desktop, or burn different mixes to blank CD's, or upload different versions of the same songs to sites like SoundCloud, which do not enable you to toggle between multiple mixes to really compare the subtle nuances.
